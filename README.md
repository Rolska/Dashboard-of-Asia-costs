# Asia_costs_summary
In 2023, I went backpacking to Southeast Asia with my friend from Poland. We bought a one-way ticket, and our goal was to stay in Asia for a minimum of 4 months. Due to a limited budget, we calculated that in order to spend a few months in travel we should spend 52 PLN (12 EUR) per day - including accommodation, food, transportation and tourist attractions. During our trip we had the opportunity to participate in many workaways (volunteering), which helped us to keep in the budget. Throughout the entire travel I kept track of our expenses, to finally build the following dashboard based on them.

The costs are divided into two main sectors: by time and by country. On the left side, there is a graph showing how much we spent on a given day or selected period. On the right, there is a pivot table summarizing spending in each country in every category (transportation, food, accommodation and others). Also on the graphs, with the use of the slicers, it is easy to see how much we spent while being on workaway or without volunteering.

In the attachment please find an excel file that includes the dashoboard shown in the above screenshot.
